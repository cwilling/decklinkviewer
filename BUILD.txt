A decklinkviewer.pro file that works for me is included.
It may need minor modifications to work on other systems
    e.g. remove "-lswscale" from LIBS

To generate the Makefile, run:
  qmake decklinkviewer.pro

Now run:
  make

The decklinkviewer executable expects to be told which
input connection (-i option) and which pixel format (-m)
to use. A typical invocation is:
    ./decklinkviewer -i1 -m8
(HDMI input, 1080i50 on a Decklink Extreme 3D card)

Use:
    ./decklink -l
to obtain a listing of the available connection and pixel
format types.
